# React Pizza

This is a simple web application that replicates the logic of a pizza ordering page. Here you can find your favorite pizza in the search, filter pizzas by rating, price and alphabet, and add your chosen pizzas to the cart. Here you can do almost everything except ordering pizzas (_unfortunately, I did not add this logic_)
